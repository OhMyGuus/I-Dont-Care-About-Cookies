## Fork of the popular "I don't care about cookies" extension

Get rid of cookie warnings from almost all websites!

## Why fork?

This extension has been acquired by _**[Avast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avast)**_ (which itself has been acquired by _[Gen Digital Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Digital)_, a large tech conglomerate) and I simply don't trust Avast with my data. Additionally, having it on Github allows us to improve the code and add support for websites faster.
