## Fork of the popular "I don't care about cookies" extension
Get rid of cookie warnings from almost all websites!

##  Why fork?
This extension has been acquired by Avast and simply I don't trust Avast with my data.
Also having it on Github allows us to improve the code & add support for websites faster.
